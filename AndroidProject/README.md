<img src="/screenshot.png" alt="Sensor Visualization" width="400px"/>

This simple application supports the real time visualization of all sensor data of your phone in form of a line graph.
It does not feature a description of what kind of data has been acquired and also no unit information for the sensor data is shown. It outputs the data just as they come in provided by Google's APIs.

In the case of an accelerometer, the read out data will be x-axis, y-axis and z-axis (in this order) and the unit m/s^2.

To get more information about the description and units of the sensor data check out: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html
Be aware that the app also doesn't feature the recording of sensor data.
